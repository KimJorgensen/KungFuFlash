EasyFlash3 BBS v1.0 - Kung Fu Flash version
-------------------------------------------

This directory contains a modified version of "EasyFlash3 BBS 1.0" by Tom-Cat -
original release archive can be found here: https://csdb.dk/release/?id=159907

To activate the USB connection in this modified version you must press the Menu
button to enter the Kung Fu Flash menu (not the Easy Flash 3 menu).  You will
then need to find the new serial connection:
  * For Windows look for a new "Serial USB device ( COM x )" entry in the
  Device Manager under "Connections (COM & LPT)".  For Windows 11 you may need
  to right click on your computer name at the top of the device list and enable
  legacy devices.
  * For Linux run "sudo dmesg" immediately after plugging in the USB cable to
  see the name of the serial connection - e.g. /dev/ttyACM3

				        v1.0

This is a simple BBS client for the C64 that has an
Easy Flash 3 cartridge connected to the PC via USB
connection.
Basically it is a telnet client, but it is mostly
used to connect to the numerous C64 BBS servers that
are still out there.

To start just reset your C64 into the Easy Flash 3
Menu and start the   ef3bbs.exe   on your PC.
The Client program will be automatically started on
the c64. There you can select one of the predefined
bbs addresses or enter your own. If you need to have
a different port number than 23 then enter it after
the address separated with a : ... for example:
  c64.bbs.com:64
  
You can save the bookmarks on the PC by pressing the
S key. They will be automatically loaded next time
you start the BBS client.

By selecting one of the addresses you will connect
to the BBS. To return back to the main menu press
F7. There you can select another BBS and connect to
that one.

While connected to the BBS you can initiate a file
transfer to and from the BBS. When you do that you
must have the file on the PC filesystem and press
one of the keys for transfer (x and 1 for xmodem
download and u for x modem upload).
