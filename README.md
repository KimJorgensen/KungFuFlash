# Kung Fu Flash

Cartridge for the Commodore 64 that packs a punch.

![Kung Fu Flash Launcher](pics/launcher.jpg)

Kung Fu Flash can emulate different cartridge types, load PRG files and use D64 disk images.
Just place your desired CRT, PRG or D64 files on a FAT formatted microSD card and use the built-in launcher to execute them.

## Hardware

There are three buttons on the cartridge; a reset button, a menu button for starting the launcher, and a special button that is used by the freezer cartridges.

The PCB will fit the Stumpy Cartridge Case from TFW8b, you just need to drill some holes for the buttons and make a cut for the microSD card.
If you have mounted the USB connector you will need to cut a hole for that as well.

You can also 3D print a cartridge case as the one designed by bigby, [see here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4153414).

## Supported File Types

The following file types are currently supported:

* Cartridge (CRT)
* C64/C128 generic cartridge (ROM, BIN)
* Disk image (D64, D71, D81)
* Tape image (T64)
* Program (PRG, P00)
* Firmware update (UPD)
* Text document (TXT, NFO, 1ST)

## USB Port

The USB port allows programs or disk images to be transferred from/to a PC using the EasyFlash 3 USB protocol.
The USB port is active when:

* The Kung Fu Flash launcher is running
* A program is started using "Load" in the file options menu (SHIFT+RETURN)
* BASIC is started via F7 in the launcher

Kung Fu Flash shows up as a standard serial port when connected to a PC not requiring any custom drivers to be installed.
This means, however, that the EasyFlash 3 program on the PC side must be modified to support Kung Fu Flash.
For that reason a modified version of [EasyFlash 3 USB Utilities](3rd_party/ef3utils) and [EasyFlash 3 BBS](3rd_party/ef3bbs) has been included in this repository.

## Firmware Update

Just place the KungFuFlash_v1.xx.upd file on the SD card and select the file in the launcher to initiate the firmware update.
The newest firmware can be found [here](https://github.com/KimJorgensen/KungFuFlash/releases/).

For initial firmware installation, [see here](firmware/README.md).

## Limitations

Kung Fu Flash is a so called Software Defined Cartridge where a fast microcontroller emulates cartridge hardware in software.
This makes it extremely flexible, allowing different cartridge types to be supported at a relative low cost.

However, it can be challenging to get the C64 bus timing correct in software and in some places the timing is very close to the limit.
Even though Kung Fu Flash has been tested on different models of the Commodore 64, there is a chance that it doesn't work correctly on your specific model, or requires [phi2 offset adjustment](firmware/README.md#diagnostic).
Use it at your own risk!

Kung Fu Flash will work with the PAL and NTSC version of the Commodore 64 or Commodore 128.

Disk drive emulation is using kernal vectors and will not work with fast loaders or software that uses direct hardware access which a lot of games does.
Currently REL files are not supported and only a subset of the Commodore DOS commands are supported.
