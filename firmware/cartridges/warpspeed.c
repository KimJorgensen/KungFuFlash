 * Warp Speed has an easy hardware setup
 * - a single 16k bank that can be turned on or off
 * - read $DE00-$DFFF is a mirror of $9E00-$9FFF
 * - write $DE00-$DEFF turns ROM on
 * - write $DF00-$DFFF turns ROM off
 * still it's twice as fast as JiffyDOS and can load to RAM at $D000-$DFFF,
 * and also packs a lot of features.
 *
 * MACH 5 has a similar hardware setup to Warp Speed but only has an 8k bank
