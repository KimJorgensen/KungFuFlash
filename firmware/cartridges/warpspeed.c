 * Warp Speed has an easy hardware setup
 * - a single 16k bank that can be turned on or off
 * - read $DE00-$DFFF is a mirror of $9E00-$9FFF
 * - write $DE00-$DEFF turns ROM on
 * - write $DF00-$DFFF turns ROM off
 * still it's twice as fast as JiffyDOS and can load to RAM at $D000-$DFFF,
 * and also packs a lot of features.
 * the original hardware features also a C128 mode, which can't be recreated
 * using a crt image.
